# Curent Status
This version of the firmware is based from the 2.3.3 Version of the JGMaker Firmware.   I do not own a Pro version of the Artist-D so I rely heaviliy on the commity to test and proof my firmware releases.  

## Getting the Upstram Marlin
There are some instructions here for setting your repository with the upstream Marlin Source. 
https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork

$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations.git

Thie will set an upstream remote that you can fetch and merge from.
